# Contributing to VulpineOS

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here's how to get started.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Bug reports** — Open an issue with steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- **Feature requests** — Open an issue describing the use case and why it's useful.
- **Code contributions** — Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a pull request.
- **Documentation** — Fixes and improvements to docs are always welcome.

## Development Setup
See README.md

## Pull Request Rules

1. Each pull request must be associated with a Github issue
2. Follow the pull request template
3. Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit.
4. Open a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why.
5. All pull requests must pass the relevant checks for the files changed before merging.

## Repository Scope

This public repository is for high-level architecture, orchestration, public integration surfaces, compatibility fixes, documentation, tests, and release hygiene. Do not open public PRs that add large product features, larger feature proposals, unreviewed planning detail, implementation detail, or sensitive operational infrastructure. If a change would reveal out-of-scope implementation details, discuss the intended repository scope with a maintainer before opening a PR.

## Testing Requirements

For most VulpineOS runtime changes, run:

```bash
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/...
```

If you change the web panel, also run:

```bash
npm --prefix web test -- --run
npm --prefix web run build
```

The browser-layer test suites below are required when you change Firefox/Camoufox patches, browser fingerprinting code, or Python package integration. They test different layers of the browser stack and catch different classes of bugs.

### build-tester

Tests the **raw binary** in isolation, bypassing the Python package entirely. Fingerprints are injected manually via `generate_context_fingerprint` + `addInitScript` (per-context mode) and via the `CAMOU_CONFIG` environment variable (global mode). It also validates that injected values actually appear in the page via match result checks.

**Run this when you change:** browser patches, Firefox source modifications, WebGL/canvas/audio spoofing, WebRTC IP handling, or anything in the C++/JS browser layer.

```bash
cd build-tester
npm install          # first time only
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/run_tests.py /path/to/camoufox-binary
```

See [`build-tester/README.md`](build-tester/README.md) for full details.

### service-tester

Tests the **full stack** — the binary and the Python package together — using only the public `AsyncNewContext` API. Fingerprints are generated entirely by camoufox/browserforge with no manual injection. Real proxies are required; the WebRTC IP and timezone are auto-derived from each proxy's exit IP. This is a black-box trust test: if it fails, the fix belongs in the Python package, not in the test.

**Run this when you change:** `pythonlib/` (fingerprint generation, `AsyncNewContext`, `NewContext`), proxy handling, or any behaviour that affects how the Python package interacts with the binary.

```bash
cd service-tester
# Add proxies (one per line, format: user:pass@domain:port)
cp proxies.txt.example proxies.txt   # or create manually
./run_tests.sh
```

See [`service-tester/README.md`](service-tester/README.md) for full details.

### Key differences

| | build-tester | service-tester |
|---|---|---|
| Entry point | Raw browser binary path | local Python package install |
| Fingerprint injection | Manual | Via `AsyncNewContext` API |
| Global mode (`CAMOU_CONFIG`) | yes | no |
| Match result validation | yes | no |
| Proxy required | no | yes |
| Profiles | 8 (6 per-context + 2 global) | 6 (per-context) |
| Fix target on failure | Browser source | Python package |

## Reporting Issues

Please search existing issues before opening a new one. Include:
- VulpineOS commit or release version
- Browser binary path/version, if the bug involves a live browser
- OS, Go version, and Node.js version
- Exact run command and a minimal reproducible example

## Questions

For usage questions, check the [documentation](https://docs.vulpineos.com) first. For anything else, open an issue.
